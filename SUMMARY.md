**Supervisely HRDA Plants Demo** is a dataset for instance segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks. It is used in the agricultural and robotics industries. 

The dataset consists of 2284 images with 1482 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *sugar beet* and *weed*.

Images in the Supervisely HRDA Plants Demo dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 2000 (88% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *unlabeled* (2000 images), *validation* (222 images), and *labeled* (62 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the Supervisely.

Here is the visualized example grid with animated annotations:
