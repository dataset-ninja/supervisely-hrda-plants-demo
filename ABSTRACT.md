This dataset is a part of [Sugar Beets 2016](https://datasetninja.com/sugar-beets-2016) Dataset, which is used in the experiment ["How to Train a Model with Only 62 Labeled Images using Semi-supervised Learning"](https://supervisely.com/blog/train-a-model-with-62-labeled-images-hrda-semi-supervised) conducted by Supervisely Team. The experiment reveals the potential of semi-supervised learning and proves the opportunity to train a good model using only a small fraction of labeled data, thereby significantly minimizing manual effort and cost of data labeling.
